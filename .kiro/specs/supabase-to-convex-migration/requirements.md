# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Debt Tracker application from a tRPC + Supabase architecture to a Convex-based architecture. The migration aims to simplify the backend architecture by replacing the tRPC API layer and Supabase database with Convex's unified backend solution, while maintaining all existing functionality and improving developer experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace the tRPC API layer with Convex functions, so that I can have a simpler, more integrated backend architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL use Convex functions instead of tRPC routers for all API operations
2. WHEN a client makes a request THEN the system SHALL handle it through Convex functions rather than tRPC procedures
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all tRPC-related code SHALL be removed from the codebase
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API contract for frontend components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate all database operations from Supabase to Convex, so that I can use a single backend solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all database operations SHALL use Convex's database API instead of Supabase
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the Convex schema SHALL support all existing data models (debts, payments, payment_plans)
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing data SHALL be preserved and accessible through Convex
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all Supabase-related code SHALL be removed from the codebase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update frontend components to use Convex React hooks, so that I can maintain type safety and real-time capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all frontend components SHALL use Convex React hooks instead of tRPC hooks
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain type safety between frontend and backend
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN real-time updates SHALL work through Convex's reactive queries
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing UI functionality SHALL work without changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement all debt management operations in Convex, so that users can continue to manage their debts seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a debt THEN the system SHALL store it in Convex with all required fields
2. WHEN a user retrieves debts THEN the system SHALL return all debts for the authenticated user from Convex
3. WHEN a user updates a debt THEN the system SHALL modify the debt record in Convex
4. WHEN a user deletes a debt THEN the system SHALL remove the debt record from Convex
5. WHEN a user requests debt statistics THEN the system SHALL calculate and return statistics from Convex data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement all payment operations in Convex, so that users can continue to track their payments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a payment THEN the system SHALL store it in Convex and update the associated debt balance
2. WHEN a user retrieves payments THEN the system SHALL return payments from Convex with proper filtering
3. WHEN a user updates a payment THEN the system SHALL modify the payment record in Convex and adjust debt balances
4. WHEN a user deletes a payment THEN the system SHALL remove the payment from Convex and restore the debt balance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement payment plan operations in Convex, so that users can continue to use debt repayment strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a payment plan THEN the system SHALL store it in Convex with proper strategy configuration
2. WHEN a user activates a payment plan THEN the system SHALL deactivate other plans and activate the selected one
3. WHEN a user requests strategy calculations THEN the system SHALL compute debt avalanche and snowball strategies using Convex
4. WHEN a user requests payment plan metrics THEN the system SHALL calculate and return metrics from Convex data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain authentication integration, so that user data remains secure and properly isolated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a request THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using Clerk integration with Convex
2. WHEN accessing user data THEN the system SHALL ensure data isolation based on the authenticated user ID
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing authentication flows SHALL continue to work unchanged

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up legacy code, so that the codebase is maintainable and doesn't contain unused dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all tRPC dependencies SHALL be removed from package.json
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all Supabase dependencies SHALL be removed from package.json
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all tRPC configuration files SHALL be removed
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all Supabase configuration files SHALL be removed
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the supabase/ directory SHALL be removed
